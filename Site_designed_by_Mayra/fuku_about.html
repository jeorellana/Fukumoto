					<p>Kazu Fukumoto was born on October 15, 1979, in the northern shore of Japan’s Kyushu Island, Fukuoka. In 1999, he initiated his culinary career by working as a dishwasher at Musashino Sushi Dokoro. Kazu worked his way up to become a sushi chef under the apprenticeship of the owner and chef - Smokey Fuse. He continued to hone his skills for 10 years as Head Sushi Chef at Musashino, and by later taking the ‘Taste of Japan’ course at CIA in Napa Valley. After departing from Musashino, Kazu traveled back to Japan to study traditional <i>yakitori</i> skills at Hiroya Yakitori in Tokyo. On September 3, 2015 - his dream was realized when he opened Fukumoto: Sushi & Yakitori Izakaya, serving up traditional Japanese cuisine in a casual gastropub setting. He loves to share his passion for food with everyone around him and continues to do so with his evolving daily menu.</p>

						<h3>What is Izakaya?</h3>
						<p class="txt-about-comments">An Izakaya is a type of Japanese gastropub. Originally, Izakayas were meant to have a ‘down-to-earth’ atmosphere and sake bar where guests could come to relax, eat and drink. Traditionally, in an Izakaya restaurant one would initiate the meal by ordering a drink first and then proceeding to browse the menu. Food and drinks are typically ordered slowly, over several courses and the meal is generally shared by everyone at the table.</p>

							<h3 class="txt-comments">Yakitori</h3>
							<p class="">The word ‘yakitori’ can be broken down into two parts: <b><i>yaki</i></b> meaning open fire and tori meaning chicken. Essentially, yakitori is meat skewers grilled over Japanese charcoal called <b><i>binchotan</i></b>. Although seemingly simple, this traditional Japanese method combined with the smoke from binchotan creates a very complex and unique flavor.
